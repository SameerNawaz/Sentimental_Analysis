Positive,Just a short note to give you some feedback on Kiran.  He helped me with a password technical problem.  He fixed is short order and was very helpful and informative.  He set up several website Bookmarks for me and set Google Chrome as my default browser.
Positive,I’d give him a rating of 10 out of 10!

Positive,"I recently dealt with Apar Gupta and was very impressed with the care, attention and follow up that he provided me. I work in customer care myself so I know just how rare this care is. He definitely needs a pat on the back!!!"

Positive,I appreciate Shashanka’s quick response and ownership.
Positive,I want to drop you a quick email to let you know about a wonderful experience I had with Nuthan today.

Positive,"Hi all, just wanted to pass on my experience with IDC helpdesk last night."
Positive,"Had an issue and needed to get assistance, it was my first time calling our helpdesk since I started a year ago and I was quite impressed with the gentleman who helped me.  I think it was Edwin, but I am not 100% sure."
Positive,"Super helpful, super quick, and super easy."
Positive,"I just wanted to let you know that it was a pleasure working with Shashikanth Pawar. He was very professional and knowledgeable. Even with me being frustrated and quick to click on a button, he exercised extreme patience. After speaking with him, I feel more confident about accessing my work tools."
Positive,"I wanted to reach out to you today to share some feedback about a very positive interaction I had with Mohammed today.  Mohammed helped me to install a soft token on my lap top.  I know this may not seem like a big problem to have. However this is a problem I have been trying to get resolved for over a month, as I am a remote worker and do not have access to a TechKnow bar."
Positive,"Mohammed was wonderful to work with, he took the time to understand the problem I had been facing and the error messages I kept receiving when trying to download the soft token for VPN login.  He connected to my laptop remotely, worked through the problem, resolved the soft token error, got it installed and stayed connected until he was sure I was able to log out and log back on."
Positive,"Mohammed never appeared to be in a hurry, or rushed to get the job done.  He was very polite and made sure all my questions were answered.   I really appreciated the help that Mohammed provided and wanted to make sure you are aware of the high level of service that Mohammed provides his customers."
Positive,I just wanted to let you know that Prem is an asset to Intuit and he is excellent at working with others.  He is very efficient and knowledgable.
Positive,I really appreciate him and all his help today.   He is wonderful!
Positive,"Hey I just wanted to let you know of the great experience I had with Prashanth. I have been having issues for over a week with signing into Jabber. He quickly did LMI session and was able to reset. But what I liked most, was that he didn't make me feel incompetent. He did explain what had happened and that I was doing everything correctly. I just wanted to give Kudos where it is warranted. A lot of times people can complain but never speak of the good things in life and he was great to work with. "

Positive,"Just wanted to reach out to you and tell you what a pleasure it was working with Prem over the last week and a half on a tech issue I had.   Approximately a week and a half ago I changed my windows password.  Unfortunately, it did not sync with SSO nor did it sync with outlook.   Prem was my contact for this issue and not only did he get me up and running quickly, but he also followed up with me over the next few days to ensure that I was able to change my password and that everything was synching up like it should.   I had a few little glitches and I was able to reach out to him and he responded immediately."
Positive,His technical ability to help me quickly so I would have no down time is commendable.
Positive,"However, his ability to understand my issue and empathize with me as well as making himself available after everything was done is what truly resonates with me.   All too often, the ticket is closed or put on hold and can be easily forgotten by the support tech or me.  Not the case here, Prem was amazing."
Neutral,I hope this feedback is helpful.
Positive,"You prob get to see the surveys and feedback but just wanted to say that, as always, my helpdesk help was spot on and Amtul was quick, didn't make me feel dim (which I definitely was!) and super friendly - thanks!"
Positive,"I can’t thank you enough for rescuing me out of many of my unprecedented IT situations. Yesterday though was very unique to me. Being in the US, away from the office/hotel and having my phone crash was something I was definitely not prepared for. The expected response in this situation would have been for someone to tell me that I should reach out to the TechknowBar in the MTV office, but you didn’t mention that even once!"
Neutral,"Hi Anjan, Manish,"
Positive,"Thank you for having awesome team members like Rakesh around. Rakesh has been super responsive (as always) the minute I reached out to him. He stayed connected with me all through and helped me restore whatever was possible last night. All this while I was miles away. It is extremely comforting to know that he understood my situation, empathized and really lived by customer-obsession. This is true delight."
Positive,Can you please make some changes to this DL: CTO-Dev FDS-IDC CTO-DevFDS-IDC@intuit.com?
Positive,You need to remove CTO-Dev Staff Muni Directs CTO-DevStaffMuniDirects@intuit.com from the above DL and add “CTO-Dev Raju FDS Directs CTO-DevRajuFDSDirects@intuit.com” instead.. 
Positive,"I want to give a HUGE thank you to Nuthan, I have called at least 10 times in the last few months with no help and a multitude of problems. I was promised tickets would be created and local IT would come help, after reaching out to local IT and being advised they have gotten NO tickets about anything I realized nothing was going to get done so I called again today. Nuthan  was quick to understand my frustration and made sure I had the ticket number in hand before we finished our call. He was amazing and I truly appreciate his help. I feel like I have finally started down the path to getting my computer fixed. "
Positive,Thank you again and have a great day. 
Neutral,"Hi Manish,"
Positive,"I wanted to quickly drop you  a line and say I had a great experience with Amtul today, when he was able to help me with a problem related to a distribution list, really quickly. It’s great when that happens!"
Neutral,Tzvika
Positive,"Wanted to take the time and tell you about my experience with Apar.  Several times he has been able to assist me with an issue related to my outlook and done an amazing job.  The last time he helped me was earlier this week after I had contacted the regular help desk number and was told they couldn’t help me at all.  Attempted to fix the issue on my own but was unsuccessful which is when I reached out to Apar via slack and he was willing to help immediately.  I must say it wasn’t an easy fix and took approximately 3 hours but he was always patient and stayed in constant communication via slack.  He is very knowledgeable and efficient but most important cares about assisting his teammates like me in solving problems/issues.  In addition, he took the time to follow up and ensure all was working well the next day.  "
Positive,Apar went aboveandbeyond his role to help me which I am sure he does with every call!!  Great representation of our Deliver Awesome Value!!!!
Positive,Apar Gupta is very helpful! He helped me to reset my password twice in just one day. No long waiting time. I was able to use my log in again in just five minutes. 
Positive,I am writing to you to inform you about a recent experience I have had with Prem. Prem went aboveandbeyond to assist me with a Visio install issue and did everything in his power to solve the issue for me. He was attentive by checking in with me on a frequent basis and quickly identified the issue and solved it. I have opened quite a few tickets in the past year and my experience with Prem was the best that I have received thus far. Prem is becoming quite popular on our team as some other team members have experience a similar install problem. When opening their ticket they are requesting Prem to help out since he did such a great job with me. 
Positive,I would like to thank Prem again for his awesome experience! 
Positive,"Wanted to express my appreciation for Shashanka and Karthik for their hekp in migrating me through the experience of my laptop refresh. As I shifted from Windows to ios, I am going through the nerd experience and Shashanka has been extremely patient to walk me through all my questions. You have an amazing team and great to see the customer orientation and the agility of response."
Positive,I wanted to send you a thank you for the wonderfully polite and professional representative Shashikanth Pawar. My system is working great again thanks to his efforts.
Positive,This is with reference to support that I received from Shashanka  M  this evening.   Would like to thank him for the excellent support he gave me and suggested me to submit a right ticket which I was not aware being a new consultant in this group.  I am very much impressed with his knowledge in fixing the issues very quickly and resolving the problem. He deserves all encouragement and support from the upper management.   He knows what he is doing.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any question.
Positive,"Just a quick word about Edwin and what a pleasure it was to work with him. By far he is the best technician with which I have worked.  He’s strengths are that is wants to help, he is an intuitive problem solver and he knows what he is doing. Well done to Edwin."
Positive,Prashanth Munuswamy  was patient and able to resolve my latency issues and get me up and running. Good job!
Negative,Can you please partner with Amutl to understand what occurred with this user. I have a couple of concerns on the interaction below:
Negative,It sounds like from the chat that the customers pin was not being accepted which was in turn postponing his option to get in with the passcode since it wasn’t working which he needed to be able enter in order to approve Duo. I notice that Amtul referred the customer to Ovation but this is something that should be able to be addressed via the EMM console. It turns out that whatever action was ultimately taken wiped out the customer setting entirely requiring him to have to reset everything up. There isn’t much more to the chat interaction below so I’d like to understand from Amtuls perspective what happened and where the breakdown is. I also want to ensure the IDC team has the knowledge and access to handle EMM support contacts should they receive them so please confirm this as well.
Negative,"Thank you for any additional insight we can get, I don’t want people to think our IDC support team can’t help."
Positive,"Kudos Amtul !!! Thank you for your effort providing such awesome support experience to our customers…""""
"
Positive,"Hope this email finds you well!  I recently reached out to tech support and was lucky to get Shashikanth on the phone.  He was very knowledgeable and was able to trouble shoot and correct my technical issue in 5 minutes.  I was traveling and frustrated that I couldn’t access the vpn to catch up on my work.  I’m very thankful for his assistance.
